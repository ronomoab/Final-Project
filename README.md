## 📘 Features

### 🧾 Transaction Management
- Create new transactions with **auto-generated unique transaction numbers**  
  Format: `MMDDYY-XX` (e.g., `110225-01`)
- Supports multiple document requests under one transaction.
- Automatically calculates fees based on document type.

### 📅 Date-Based Viewing
- View only the transactions made **today**.
- View all **transactions for the current month**.
- New JSON file is created **every month** for easy record separation.

### 🔍 Search, Update, and Complete Transactions
- Unified interface for:
  - Searching by **Transaction Number**, **Date**, or **Status**.
  - Updating transaction details:
    - Change document type (fee auto-recalculates)
    - Edit first name, last name, purpose, and address
  - Marking a transaction as **Completed**

### 📦 Automatic Archiving
- Transactions are automatically archived when a new month starts.
- Archived transactions are stored in a separate file:  
  `archived_transactions.json`

### 🏠 Simplified Address Input
Users can easily enter their address using guided input:
- Enter House Number  
- Choose from predefined streets:
  - San Bartolome St.
  - Sta. Cruz
  - Nazareno
  - San Juan
  - Sto. Niño
  - Delarosa  
→ Automatically appends *San Pascual, Obando, Bulacan*.

### 🎨 Color-Coded Interface
- Uses the `colorama` library for a vibrant terminal display:
  - 🟩 Green: Success messages  
  - 🟨 Yellow: Warnings  
  - 🟥 Red: Errors  
  - 🟦 Cyan: Headers and prompts

├── main.py # Main program file

----------------------------------

Each monthly JSON file (e.g., `barangay_data_2025_11.json`) stores:
```json
{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "transaction_number": "110225-01",
            "documents": [...],
            "total_fee": 90,
            "status": "Pending",
            "date_created": "2025-11-02"
        }
    ],
    "archived": []
}
